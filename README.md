## ðŸ”§ Contents Include:

<br>

  -Flip-flops and latches (D, T, JK)
  -Counters (Up, Down, Mod-N, Johnson)
  -Multiplexers and Demultiplexers
  -Encoders and Decoders
  -Arithmetic units (Adders, Subtractors, Multipliers)
  -FSM implementations
  -Memory modules (RAM, ROM)
  -Custom testbenches for verification
  -Timing diagrams and waveform analysis

<br>

## ðŸ§  Ideal For:
College lab assignments
Digital design interviews
Learning RTL coding best practices
